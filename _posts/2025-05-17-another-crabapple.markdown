I noticed that there are some more random little crabapple trees growing in the back of the yard. There was one growing out of the side of a rotting stump. The roots were surprisingly loose compared to the one that was in the driveway, and I was able to pull the whole thing out easily with my hands. It ended up being a few different plants all somewhat connected by the root system. Here they are just pulled from the ground:

I'm not sure if they will have enough of a root system to survive being potted, but it seemed worth a try.

Here they are in their pots:

I put them over by Barcus.
