This afternoon I dug up and potted a bunch of small maples and yew.

I love how the tiny maple tress look in these little pots. I hope they grow bigger, but even at this tiny size they are pretty cute.

I wouldn't have thought to use yew for bonsai, but there were a bunch of small ones growing around the yard, and it sounds like they are a common plant for bonsai. There are a bunch of bigger ones we can work from as well, but these two tiny ones look so adorable.

Django helped babysit them in the car on the way home. (Actually, he was very annoying and I had to work on stopping him from stepping on the trees.)

They made it home safely! Here they are with their new friends.
