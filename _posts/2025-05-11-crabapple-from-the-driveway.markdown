There was an old crabapple growing like a weed at the very edge of the driveway. In past years, it has been repeatedly cut back, but it keeps growing back. It seems indestructible. I decided to dig it out to see if it would be interesting as a bonsai, instead of a weed.

The roots were pretty robust, holding it in firmly. I had to carefully dig out around all the roots, ripping a big hole in the side of the garden.

Ronan helped! Sort of. He mostly just got really muddy.

I finally got it out! There had been a very large tap root holding the whole thing into the ground that needed to be cut. I saved a lot of the other root system.

To get it to fit into the pot, I needed to cut a bit more of the main roots off, but I think it will do pretty well.
